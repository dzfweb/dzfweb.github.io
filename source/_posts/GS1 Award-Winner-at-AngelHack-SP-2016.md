This weekend I participated in the biggest hackathon in the world, present in several countries, the AngelHack edition SÃ£o Paulo 2016.

The contest brought together 220 students and professionals from the areas of software programming, design and communication. There were around 30 hours of intense immersion for multidisciplinary teams, with the help of around 80 mentors, to create technological solutions in the form of applications aimed at social good or research and innovation.

My team was the winner in the Barcode Technological Innovation category. We have developed a multiplatform solution for trading and donating perishable products, taking advantage of GS1's APIs to register and consult products by barcode.

It was a very good experience to participate in an event full of programmers and people who love technology, here are some photos.
