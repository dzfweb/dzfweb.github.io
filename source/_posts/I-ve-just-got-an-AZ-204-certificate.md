Azure and Microsoft in general always was part of my background as a Software Engineer. I've been working with Azure for a long time, but my experiences was more leading teams that used to use Azure, I mean, I was not the one who was doing the actual work. I was more like the manager supporting the expert team building the solutions. Yeah, of course, I was doing some work, but it was more like a support role. And this certification was a personal challenge for me to prove myself that I was able to do the job with my hands if it is needed.

The AZ-204 certification, also known as “Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure”, is designed for Azure developers. It validates your skills in designing, building, testing, and maintaining cloud applications and services on Microsoft Azure. As a candidate for this exam, you’ll be responsible for participating in all phases of development, including requirements gathering, design, development, deployment, security, maintenance, performance tuning, and monitoring.

The exam measures your ability to accomplish the following technical tasks:

- Develop Azure compute solutions
- Develop for Azure storage
- Implement Azure security
- Monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize Azure solutions
- Connect to and consume Azure services and third-party services

I'm glad to achieve this and hope for a possible expert certificate in the future, let's see...
