Experienced Software Engineering & Manager with a demonstrated history of working in the capital markets industry with knowledge from the development environment, coding, support, as well as technology management in complex environments, technology budget and projects.

Throughout the career had opportunity to work with a large variety of technologies among them that stand out: Microsoft Tecnologies (C#, .NET, Azure), node.js, typescript and react.

In 2013 I got to know ASP.NET FRAMEWORK with C# and the set of tools that Microsoft provides to developers, and it became the flagship in my daily life with development. From then on, I had contact in personal and professional projects in Web Forms, Windows Forms and MVC. In June 2014 I started the startup Zanco Automação Comercial, an application for automation and management of small and medium-sized wholesale and retail companies. In April 2016, through the IBM Hackathon in partnership with GS1, I participated in the creation of the then TemPraJá project, today a startup, which aims to avoid the waste of perishable products through a multiplatform system of commerce and donation,
