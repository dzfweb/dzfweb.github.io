Engineer with proven experience in leading high performance teams\n\n## Who am I?\n\nI consider a complete engineer in essence, not limited to a specific technology, but in solving the problem and bringing benefit to the company. I have a high capacity for learning and adaptation to environments.\n\n![](images/dzfweb.png)\n\nExperienced Software Engineering & Manager with a demonstrated history of working in the capital markets industry with knowledge from the development environment, coding, support, as well as technology management in complex environments, technology budget and projects.\n\nThroughout the career had opportunity to work with a large variety of technologies among them that stand out: Microsoft Tecnologies (C#, .NET, Azure), node.js, typescript and react.\n\n## First contact with Programming…\n\nIn 2003, at age 13, when HPG and KIT.NET still existed, and allowed users with no programming knowledge to create their personal pages.

By the end of this article, I hope you’ll be interested in you the interest in developing a plugin and contributing to the community of NativeScript developers, everyone wins when this happens!.\n\n## Por onde começar?\n\nI will demonstrate the basics that you need to know to get started, but if you prefer, the complete documentation can be found here.\n\nThe easiest way to get a plugin for NativeScript is to use the NativeScript Plugin Seed, created by NathanWalker. This library will do all the hard work of creating the structure of a NativeScript plugin, and that’s really amazing. See how easy it is:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/NathanWalker/nativescript-plugin-seed.git myplugin\ncd myplugin\nnpm run postclone\nnpm run setup\n```\n\nNow, with just these steps you will have created all the necessary structure to develop, test and publish your plugin, but before you start, let’s make a brief introduction about the plugin we are going to develop together in this article.\n\n## O plugin NativeScript Emoji\nThe purpose of this plugin is to deliver an element to the interface to display Emojis in a friendly way. My initial idea was to have a TextView element. When setting the unicode or hexadecimal value of emoji in the corresponding property:\n\n`<Emoji:Emoji icon=\"128514\">` exibir :😂\n\nThe plugin would do the conversion to Emoji, and here I leave a highlight again for the NativeScript community in Slack (Haven’t joined us yet? Sign up now), which made the excellent suggestion to replace the unicode property with a friendlier and easier-to-remember value:\n\n`<Emoji:Emoji name=\"joy\">` exibir :😂\n\n## Implementação para Android e iOS\nNow that we already have the definition of the plugin and the structure created, get started. The first thing we need to do is define the common implementation across platforms, we know that we will have a name property that will serve both Android and iOS, this setting is made in the common file that was generated in the first step of this article .\n\n_emoji.common.ts_\n\n```\nimport { View, Property } from \"ui/core/view\";\nexport class EmojiCommon extends View {\n  name: string;\n}\nexport const nameProperty = new Property<EmojiCommon, string>(\n  {\n    name: \"name\",\n    defaultValue: \"\"\n  });\nnameProperty.register(EmojiCommon);\n```\n\nAs this is an ui plugin, we need to extend the View class. The attributes of the element that we will create, we define creating a new object of type Property.\n\nThe property name we define the name of the attribute and the default value of it, as the name itself suggests, we define the property defaultValue. If the value of this attribute were different from the type string, which is not our case, we would need to set the value for the property valueConverter.\n\nThe emojis encoding is distinct for each platform, so we need to have a database to store those values to query during the execution of the plugin.\n\n_emoji.database.ts_\n```\nexport class EmojiDatabase {\n    public static list(): Array<any> {\n      return [\n    {\n        \"name\": \"FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY\",\n        \"unicode\": \"😂\",\n        \"hexcode\": \"1F602\",\n        \"codepoint\": [\n            128514\n        ],\n        \"shortname\": \"joy\"\n    }];\n}\n```\n\n## Implementação para Android\nNow that we have the attributes of the element that we will create, we need to implement the code responsible for generating the element corresponding to each platform. NativeScript will interpret the specific code for Android at runtime through the following file.\n\n_emoji.android.ts_ \n\n```\nimport { nameProperty, EmojiCommon } from \"./emoji.common\";\nimport { EmojiDatabase } from \"./emoji.database\";\nimport * as utils from \"tns-core-modules/utils/utils\";\ndeclare var java: any;\nglobal.moduleMerge(EmojiCommon, exports);\nexport class Emoji extends EmojiCommon {\n  [nameProperty.getDefault](): string {\n    return '';\n  }\n  [nameProperty.setNative](value: string) {\n    let emoji = EmojiDatabase.list().find((el) => el.shortname ##= value).codepoint[0];\n    this.nativeView.setText(new java.lang.String(java.lang.Character.toChars(emoji)));\n  }\n  private _android: android.widget.TextView;\n  get android() {\n    return this.nativeView;\n  }\n  public createNativeView() {\n    this._android = new android.widget.TextView(utils.ad.getApplicationContext());\n    return this._android;\n  }\n}\n```\nThe first step is to extend the common class created earlier. You must implement the createNativeView method too, which will make NativeScript understand that some element must be created in the View. In our case we will create a TextView.\n\nAnd again here we have another great help from the framework, the NativeScript team has mapped all the native properties and methods of each platform and generated the definitions in TypeScript, which gives us the possibility to navigate through all these native definitions directly in the editor.\n\nWe must also define what the plugin will do when it receives the attribute name, this is defined by implementing the setNative method, which in our case will query the emoji name in the database, and based on the corresponding code, It will set the value for the previously created TextView. The getDefault method is for cases where no value is set.\n\n## Implementação para iOS\nWe can copy the same implementation made for Android, and only change the parts where it is created and set the value for the native element, which in the case of iOS will be the UILabel setting as follows.\n\n_emoji.ios.ts_ \n\n```\nimport { nameProperty, EmojiCommon } from \"./emoji.common\";\nimport { EmojiDatabase } from \"./emoji.database\";\nglobal.moduleMerge(EmojiCommon, exports);\nexport class Emoji extends EmojiCommon {\n  [nameProperty.getDefault](): number {\n    return 0;\n  }\n  [nameProperty.setNative](value: string) {\n    let emoji = EmojiDatabase.list().find((el) => el.shortname ##= value).unicode;\n    let nsString = NSString.stringWithString(emoji);\n    this.nativeView.text = nsString;\n  }\n  private _ios: UILabel;\n  get ios() {\n    return this.nativeView;\n  }\n  public createNativeView() {\n    this._ios = UILabel.alloc().init();\n    return this._ios;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere again it will be possible to access the definition of the native methods for iOS, in the createNativeView method a UILabel is created and in the setNative method the value for the created element is defined.\n\n## Testando o plugin\nYes, we finished the plugin implementation and what is left is just testing. Realy fast, dont you think? To test we need to add the plugin to the demo project created in the initial steps of this article. To do this, you must execute the command:\n```\nnpm run preparedemo\n```\n\nAdd the element reference in the Page element of the main-page.xml file\n\n\n```\nxmlns:Emoji=\"nativescript-emoji\"\n```\n\nAnd then add the element within the StackLayout\n\n\n```\n<Emoji:Emoji name=\"joy\" />\n```\n\nStating as follows:\n\n\n_main-page.xml_\n```\n<Page xmlns=\"http://schemas.nativescript.org/tns.xsd\" xmlns:Emoji=\"nativescript-emoji\" navigatingTo=\"navigatingTo\" class=\"page\">\n  \n    <Page.actionBar>\n        <ActionBar title=\"NativeScript Emoji\" icon=\"\" class=\"action-bar\">\n        </ActionBar>\n    </Page.actionBar>\n    <StackLayout orientation=\"horizontal\">\n        <Label text=\"I'm happy \"> </Label>\n        <Emoji:Emoji name=\"joy\" />\n        <Emoji:Emoji name=\"joy\" />\n        <Emoji:Emoji name=\"joy\" />\n    </StackLayout>\n</Page>\n```\n\nNow let’s run the demo project on the emulators of each platform by executing the following commands.\n```\nnmm run demo.ios\nnpm run demo.android\n```\n\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dzfweb/nativescript-emoji/master/emojiprintscreen.png)\n\n## Conclusão\nHopefully you can see how fast and easy it is to develop a plugin for NativeScript, the community is very open to helping as well, as well as the Telerik team that seeks to deliver with each version tools that vision make our work as a developer much more productive and i throw the invitation to you developer who is reading this article, did you develop something customized on any project? Do you have any ideas about any tools that might be useful?

The getDefault method is for cases where no value is set.\n\n## Implementação para iOS\nWe can copy the same implementation made for Android, and only change the parts where it is created and set the value for the native element, which in the case of iOS will be the UILabel setting as follows.\n\n_emoji.ios.ts_ \n\n```\nimport { nameProperty, EmojiCommon } from \"./emoji.common\";\nimport { EmojiDatabase } from \"./emoji.database\";\nglobal.moduleMerge(EmojiCommon, exports);\nexport class Emoji extends EmojiCommon {\n  [nameProperty.getDefault](): number {\n    return 0;\n  }\n  [nameProperty.setNative](value: string) {\n    let emoji = EmojiDatabase.list().find((el) => el.shortname ##= value).unicode;\n    let nsString = NSString.stringWithString(emoji);\n    this.nativeView.text = nsString;\n  }\n  private _ios: UILabel;\n  get ios() {\n    return this.nativeView;\n  }\n  public createNativeView() {\n    this._ios = UILabel.alloc().init();\n    return this._ios;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere again it will be possible to access the definition of the native methods for iOS, in the createNativeView method a UILabel is created and in the setNative method the value for the created element is defined.\n\n## Testando o plugin\nYes, we finished the plugin implementation and what is left is just testing. Realy fast, dont you think? To test we need to add the plugin to the demo project created in the initial steps of this article. To do this, you must execute the command:\n```\nnpm run preparedemo\n```\n\nAdd the element reference in the Page element of the main-page.xml file\n\n\n```\nxmlns:Emoji=\"nativescript-emoji\"\n```\n\nAnd then add the element within the StackLayout\n\n\n```\n<Emoji:Emoji name=\"joy\" />\n```\n\nStating as follows:\n\n\n_main-page.xml_\n```\n<Page xmlns=\"http://schemas.nativescript.org/tns.xsd\" xmlns:Emoji=\"nativescript-emoji\" navigatingTo=\"navigatingTo\" class=\"page\">\n  \n    <Page.actionBar>\n        <ActionBar title=\"NativeScript Emoji\" icon=\"\" class=\"action-bar\">\n        </ActionBar>\n    </Page.actionBar>\n    <StackLayout orientation=\"horizontal\">\n        <Label text=\"I'm happy \"> </Label>\n        <Emoji:Emoji name=\"joy\" />\n        <Emoji:Emoji name=\"joy\" />\n        <Emoji:Emoji name=\"joy\" />\n    </StackLayout>\n</Page>\n```\n\nNow let’s run the demo project on the emulators of each platform by executing the following commands.\n```\nnmm run demo.ios\nnpm run demo.android\n```\n\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dzfweb/nativescript-emoji/master/emojiprintscreen.png)\n\n## Conclusão\nHopefully you can see how fast and easy it is to develop a plugin for NativeScript, the community is very open to helping as well, as well as the Telerik team that seeks to deliver with each version tools that vision make our work as a developer much more productive and i throw the invitation to you developer who is reading this article, did you develop something customized on any project?

Amazingly, it is possible to extract the source code of any .NET project (C#, VB, etc). In this article I will share with you how it is possible to do this and how to protect your code and make this practice a little more difficult.\n\n## Understanding .NET DLLs and Executables\n\nIn summary, when you compile a code in .NET, it is not converted to machine language. All .NET languages are converted to MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) . MSIL is converted at runtime. This process offers some advantages such as dynamically querying Assemblies and their methods. However, thanks to this process, it is also possible, through reverse engineering, to access the entire algorithm of the code, its methods, variables, etc.\n\n## .NET decompilers\n\nMicrosoft has a kind of MSIL Decompiler where it is possible to access the methods of any .NET assembly (Learn more by clicking here) however, there are some more used decompilers that offer some functions in addition, such as extracting all the source code of the Assembly, including the .CSPROJ.\n\nI'm talking about Reflector (download here) and File Disassembler plugin (download here). You'll see below how the two together can extract the source code of DLLs or .NET executables.\n\nThis is the Reflector Interface. As soon as you open the program, it loads the Microsoft Assembly by default, where you can browse the methods. Until then, in amazement, because with Visual Studio it is already possible to do this.\n\nReflector\n\nI created a new very simple Windows Form C# project to use in the example. It has 1 Form and a method. In the Reflector > Open Assembly program I selected the executable I made, and then the program decodes the MSIL of the program and displays the methods.\n\nReflector\n\nNow I'm going to use the Plugin File Disassembler by selecting it in the menu Tools > File Disassembler, in the window that opens I inform the type of Project as Windows Form and the path for the output of the decompiled files. The Plugin then extracts all source code from the selected Assembly.\n\nReflector\n\nAnd then after this simple process and with access to the assembly source code, I can open it in Visual Studio without any problem.\n\nReflector\n\nWere you amazed? Yeah, me too. And because of that I left for another search.\n\n## How to Protect .NET Codes with Dotfuscator\n\nAs of the 2012 version of Visual Studio, the Dotfuscator extension from the company PreEmptive is installed by default and can be accessed in Tools >** PreEmptive Dotfuscator and Analytics **.\n\n1- When opening the DotFuscator Interface, start a new project File > New Project.\n\n2- Click on Inputs and next to it, add the Assembly or Executables that you want to obfuscate.\n(Ex: ..ProjetoBinMeuProjeto.exe)\n\n3- Click on Build > Build Project. This process will create a folder in your selected Project directory with the name Dotfuscated and the Executable or DLL with MSIL obfuscated.\n\n \n\n1\nOkay, your code has been protected and it is not possible to decompile.

And two of the tools that I've found to be particularly helpful are GitHub Copilot and Tactiq.\n\n## GitHub Copilot\n\nGitHub Copilot is an AI programming assistant that has been a game-changer when it comes to coding. With Copilot, I can quickly generate code snippets and get suggestions for how to complete functions and methods. It's like having a coding partner who's always there to help me out.\n\nWhen I'm working on a new project, I'll often use Copilot to generate some starter code. This saves me a lot of time and helps me get up and running quickly. And if I'm stuck on a particular piece of code, I'll use Copilot to get suggestions for how to complete it. This has been incredibly helpful when I'm working with a new language or framework.\n\n### Smart Auto-complete\n\nOne of the key features that sets Copilot apart is its smart auto-complete functionality. With this feature, Copilot can suggest code snippets and complete functions and methods based on the context of your code. This saves you time and helps you write code more efficiently.\n\n![](/images/My-AI-toolset-for-boost-my-dev-productivity/1.gif)\n\n### Code generation\n\nAnother powerful feature of Copilot is its code generation capability. With Copilot, you can quickly generate code for common tasks like file I/O, string manipulation, and more. This feature is particularly helpful when you're working with a new language or framework and need to get up and running quickly.\n\n![](/images/My-AI-toolset-for-boost-my-dev-productivity/2.gif)\n\n### Test generation\n\nFinally, Copilot also has a test generation feature that can help you write better code. With this feature, Copilot can generate test cases for your code, ensuring that it's working as expected and reducing the likelihood of bugs. This feature is especially useful for developers who are new to testing or who want to improve their testing practices.\n\n![](/images/My-AI-toolset-for-boost-my-dev-productivity/3.gif)\n\n## Tactiq\n\nAnother tool that I've found incredibly helpful is Tactiq. This tool is perfect for anyone who spends a lot of time in meetings. With Tactiq, I can easily transcribe meetings and keep track of important details. It's a great way to stay organized and make sure that I don't miss anything important.\n\nDuring meetings, I'll use Tactiq to transcribe what's being said. This helps me stay focused and ensures that I don't miss any important details. Plus, I can easily refer back to the transcript later if I need to.\n\n![](/images/My-AI-toolset-for-boost-my-dev-productivity/tactiq.png)\n\nAnother cool feature of Tactiq (which I believe uses gpt-4 behind the scenes) is the ability to generate action points.\n\nOverall, Tactiq has been a huge help in keeping me organized and productive. And I highly recommend it to anyone who spends a lot of time in meetings.\n","source":"_posts/My-AI-toolkit-for-boost-my-dev-productivity.md","raw":"---\ntitle: My AI toolkit for boost my dev productivity\ndate: 2023-10-23 17:33:23\ntags:\n  - Certificates\n  - AI\n  - Artificial Intelligence\n---\n\nAs a developer, I'm always looking for ways to boost my productivity.
