It’s like having a coding partner who’s always there to help me out.</p><p>When I’m working on a new project, I’ll often use Copilot to generate some starter code. This saves me a lot of time and helps me get up and running quickly. And if I’m stuck on a particular piece of code, I’ll use Copilot to get suggestions for how to complete it. This has been incredibly helpful when I’m working with a new language or framework.</p><h3 id="Smart-Auto-complete"><a href="#Smart-Auto-complete" class="headerlink" title="Smart Auto-complete"></a>Smart Auto-complete</h3><p>One of the key features that sets Copilot apart is its smart auto-complete functionality. With this feature, Copilot can suggest code snippets and complete functions and methods based on the context of your code. This saves you time and helps you write code more efficiently.</p><p><img src="/images/My-AI-toolset-for-boost-my-dev-productivity/1.gif"></p><h3 id="Code-generation"><a href="#Code-generation" class="headerlink" title="Code generation"></a>Code generation</h3><p>Another powerful feature of Copilot is its code generation capability. With Copilot, you can quickly generate code for common tasks like file I&#x2F;O, string manipulation, and more. This feature is particularly helpful when you’re working with a new language or framework and need to get up and running quickly.</p><p><img src="/images/My-AI-toolset-for-boost-my-dev-productivity/2.gif"></p><h3 id="Test-generation"><a href="#Test-generation" class="headerlink" title="Test generation"></a>Test generation</h3><p>Finally, Copilot also has a test generation feature that can help you write better code. With this feature, Copilot can generate test cases for your code, ensuring that it’s working as expected and reducing the likelihood of bugs. This feature is especially useful for developers who are new to testing or who want to improve their testing practices.</p><p><img src="/images/My-AI-toolset-for-boost-my-dev-productivity/3.gif"></p><h2 id="Tactiq"><a href="#Tactiq" class="headerlink" title="Tactiq"></a>Tactiq</h2><p>Another tool that I’ve found incredibly helpful is Tactiq. This tool is perfect for anyone who spends a lot of time in meetings. With Tactiq, I can easily transcribe meetings and keep track of important details. It’s a great way to stay organized and make sure that I don’t miss anything important.</p><p>During meetings, I’ll use Tactiq to transcribe what’s being said. This helps me stay focused and ensures that I don’t miss any important details. Plus, I can easily refer back to the transcript later if I need to.</p><p><img src="/images/My-AI-toolset-for-boost-my-dev-productivity/tactiq.png"></p><p>Another cool feature of Tactiq (which I believe uses gpt-4 behind the scenes) is the ability to generate action points.</p><p>Overall, Tactiq has been a huge help in keeping me organized and productive. And I highly recommend it to anyone who spends a lot of time in meetings.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Blazor brings .NET back to browsers</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blazor is an experiment created by Steve Sanderson that makes .NET possible for browsers using WebAssembly and DotNetAnywhere. It is not a complete Framework like Flash or Silverlight, but a test to see what is possible to do with such technology.</p><span id="more"></span><p>WebAssembly describes itself as a standard for “a secure, testable, and even deployable JavaScript virtual machine execution environment.” Although it performs better in browsers that support it natively, WebAssembly can be interpreted by older browsers through converters and asm.js.</p><p>Currently, WebAssembly is designed to support applications written in C and C++, acting as a backend compiler for clang&#x2F;LLVM. To convert C into C#, Blazor uses DotNetAnywhere, created by Chris Bacon, which is nothing more than an MSIL interpreter for the .NET Framework.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a growing number of plugins available for NativeScript that are developed by the community, and the reason for this is not only the willingness and sense of contribution from developers, but also the ease of developing a plugin for NativeScript, especially after version 3.0.</p><span id="more"></span><p>In this article, I’ll demonstrate how I developed NativeScript Emoji, my first UI Plugin for NativeScript. By the end of this article, I hope you’ll be interested in you the interest in developing a plugin and contributing to the community of NativeScript developers, everyone wins when this happens!.</p><h2 id="Por-onde-comecar"><a href="#Por-onde-comecar" class="headerlink" title="Por onde começar?"></a>Por onde começar?</h2><p>I will demonstrate the basics that you need to know to get started, but if you prefer, the complete documentation can be found here.</p><p>The easiest way to get a plugin for NativeScript is to use the NativeScript Plugin Seed, created by NathanWalker. This library will do all the hard work of creating the structure of a NativeScript plugin, and that’s really amazing. See how easy it is:</p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">git clone https://github.com/NathanWalker/nativescript-plugin-seed.git myplugin</span><br><span class="line">cd myplugin</span><br><span class="line">npm run postclone</span><br><span class="line">npm run setup</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now, with just these steps you will have created all the necessary structure to develop, test and publish your plugin, but before you start, let’s make a brief introduction about the plugin we are going to develop together in this article.</p><h2 id="O-plugin-NativeScript-Emoji"><a href="#O-plugin-NativeScript-Emoji" class="headerlink" title="O plugin NativeScript Emoji"></a>O plugin NativeScript Emoji</h2><p>The purpose of this plugin is to deliver an element to the interface to display Emojis in a friendly way. My initial idea was to have a TextView element. When setting the unicode or hexadecimal value of emoji in the corresponding property:</p><p><code>&lt;Emoji:Emoji icon=&quot;128514&quot;&gt;</code> exibir :😂</p><p>The plugin would do the conversion to Emoji, and here I leave a highlight again for the NativeScript community in Slack (Haven’t joined us yet? Sign up now), which made the excellent suggestion to replace the unicode property with a friendlier and easier-to-remember value:</p><p><code>&lt;Emoji:Emoji name=&quot;joy&quot;&gt;</code> exibir :😂</p><h2 id="Implementacao-para-Android-e-iOS"><a href="#Implementacao-para-Android-e-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Implementação para Android e iOS"></a>Implementação para Android e iOS</h2><p>Now that we already have the definition of the plugin and the structure created, get started. The first thing we need to do is define the common implementation across platforms, we know that we will have a name property that will serve both Android and iOS, this setting is made in the common file that was generated in the first step of this article .</p><p><em>emoji.common.ts</em></p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">import &#123; View, Property &#125; from &quot;ui/core/view&quot;;</span><br><span class="line">export class EmojiCommon extends View &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: string;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">export const nameProperty = new Property&lt;EmojiCommon, string&gt;(</span><br><span class="line">  &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    name: &quot;name&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">    defaultValue: &quot;&quot;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;);</span><br><span class="line">nameProperty.register(EmojiCommon);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>As this is an ui plugin, we need to extend the View class. The attributes of the element that we will create, we define creating a new object of type Property.</p><p>The property name we define the name of the attribute and the default value of it, as the name itself suggests, we define the property defaultValue. If the value of this attribute were different from the type string, which is not our case, we would need to set the value for the property valueConverter.</p><p>The emojis encoding is distinct for each platform, so we need to have a database to store those values to query during the execution of the plugin.</p><p><em>emoji.database.ts</em></p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">export class EmojiDatabase &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    public static list(): Array&lt;any&gt; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      return [</span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">        &quot;unicode&quot;: &quot;😂&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">        &quot;hexcode&quot;: &quot;1F602&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">        &quot;codepoint&quot;: [</span><br><span class="line">            128514</span><br><span class="line">        ],</span><br><span class="line">        &quot;shortname&quot;: &quot;joy&quot;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;];</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="Implementacao-para-Android"><a href="#Implementacao-para-Android" class="headerlink" title="Implementação para Android"></a>Implementação para Android</h2><p>Now that we have the attributes of the element that we will create, we need to implement the code responsible for generating the element corresponding to each platform. NativeScript will interpret the specific code for Android at runtime through the following file.</p><p><em>emoji.android.ts</em> </p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">import &#123; nameProperty, EmojiCommon &#125; from &quot;./emoji.common&quot;;</span><br><span class="line">import &#123; EmojiDatabase &#125; from &quot;./emoji.database&quot;;</span><br><span class="line">import * as utils from &quot;tns-core-modules/utils/utils&quot;;</span><br><span class="line">declare var java: any;</span><br><span class="line">global.moduleMerge(EmojiCommon, exports);</span><br><span class="line">export class Emoji extends EmojiCommon &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  [nameProperty.getDefault](): string &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    return &#x27;&#x27;;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  [nameProperty.setNative](value: string) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    let emoji = EmojiDatabase.list().find((el) =&gt; el.shortname ##= value).codepoint[0];</span><br><span class="line">    this.nativeView.setText(new java.lang.String(java.lang.Character.toChars(emoji)));</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  private _android: android.widget.TextView;</span><br><span class="line">  get android() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    return this.nativeView;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  public createNativeView() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    this._android = new android.widget.TextView(utils.ad.getApplicationContext());</span><br><span class="line">    return this._android;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The first step is to extend the common class created earlier. You must implement the createNativeView method too, which will make NativeScript understand that some element must be created in the View. In our case we will create a TextView.</p><p>And again here we have another great help from the framework, the NativeScript team has mapped all the native properties and methods of each platform and generated the definitions in TypeScript, which gives us the possibility to navigate through all these native definitions directly in the editor.</p><p>We must also define what the plugin will do when it receives the attribute name, this is defined by implementing the setNative method, which in our case will query the emoji name in the database, and based on the corresponding code, It will set the value for the previously created TextView. The getDefault method is for cases where no value is set.</p><h2 id="Implementacao-para-iOS"><a href="#Implementacao-para-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Implementação para iOS"></a>Implementação para iOS</h2><p>We can copy the same implementation made for Android, and only change the parts where it is created and set the value for the native element, which in the case of iOS will be the UILabel setting as follows.</p><p><em>emoji.ios.ts</em> </p><figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">import &#123; nameProperty, EmojiCommon &#125; from &quot;./emoji.common&quot;;</span><br><span class="line">import &#123; EmojiDatabase &#125; from &quot;./emoji.database&quot;;</span><br><span class="line">global.moduleMerge(EmojiCommon, exports);</span><br><span class="line">export class Emoji extends EmojiCommon &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  [nameProperty.getDefault](): number &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    return 0;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  [nameProperty.setNative](value: string) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    let emoji = EmojiDatabase.list().find((el) =&gt; el.shortname ##= value).unicode;</span><br><span class="line">    let nsString = NSString.stringWithString(emoji);</span><br><span class="line">    this.nativeView.text = nsString;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  private _ios: UILabel;</span><br><span class="line">  get ios() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    return this.nativeView;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  public createNativeView() &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    this._ios = UILabel.alloc().init();</span><br><span class="line">    return this._ios;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here again it will be possible to access the definition of the native methods for iOS, in the createNativeView method a UILabel is created and in the setNative method the value for the created element is defined.</p><h2 id="Testando-o-plugin"><a href="#Testando-o-plugin" class="headerlink" title="Testando o plugin"></a>Testando o plugin</h2><p>Yes, we finished the plugin implementation and what is left is just testing.

    <title>Is your .NET Project Source Code protected?</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Probably you Developer must have asked yourself: “Is my code protected?”. I came across this question at the end of a system that I had developed in .NET and was about to put it into production, and like any cautious developer, I started researching methodologies to protect my System and, consequently, the System’s source code.</p><span id="more"></span><p>Well, this study brought me an insecurity about the .NET Technology, which for me until then, was considered very safe. Amazingly, it is possible to extract the source code of any .NET project (C#, VB, etc). In this article I will share with you how it is possible to do this and how to protect your code and make this practice a little more difficult.</p><h2 id="Understanding-NET-DLLs-and-Executables"><a href="#Understanding-NET-DLLs-and-Executables" class="headerlink" title="Understanding .NET DLLs and Executables"></a>Understanding .NET DLLs and Executables</h2><p>In summary, when you compile a code in .NET, it is not converted to machine language. All .NET languages are converted to MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) . MSIL is converted at runtime. This process offers some advantages such as dynamically querying Assemblies and their methods. However, thanks to this process, it is also possible, through reverse engineering, to access the entire algorithm of the code, its methods, variables, etc.</p><h2 id="NET-decompilers"><a href="#NET-decompilers" class="headerlink" title=".NET decompilers"></a>.NET decompilers</h2><p>Microsoft has a kind of MSIL Decompiler where it is possible to access the methods of any .NET assembly (Learn more by clicking here) however, there are some more used decompilers that offer some functions in addition, such as extracting all the source code of the Assembly, including the .CSPROJ.</p><p>I’m talking about Reflector (download here) and File Disassembler plugin (download here). You’ll see below how the two together can extract the source code of DLLs or .NET executables.</p><p>This is the Reflector Interface. As soon as you open the program, it loads the Microsoft Assembly by default, where you can browse the methods. Until then, in amazement, because with Visual Studio it is already possible to do this.</p><p>Reflector</p><p>I created a new very simple Windows Form C# project to use in the example. It has 1 Form and a method. In the Reflector &gt; Open Assembly program I selected the executable I made, and then the program decodes the MSIL of the program and displays the methods.</p><p>Reflector</p><p>Now I’m going to use the Plugin File Disassembler by selecting it in the menu Tools &gt; File Disassembler, in the window that opens I inform the type of Project as Windows Form and the path for the output of the decompiled files. The Plugin then extracts all source code from the selected Assembly.</p><p>Reflector</p><p>And then after this simple process and with access to the assembly source code, I can open it in Visual Studio without any problem.</p><p>Reflector</p><p>Were you amazed? Yeah, me too. And because of that I left for another search.</p><h2 id="How-to-Protect-NET-Codes-with-Dotfuscator"><a href="#How-to-Protect-NET-Codes-with-Dotfuscator" class="headerlink" title="How to Protect .NET Codes with Dotfuscator"></a>How to Protect .NET Codes with Dotfuscator</h2><p>As of the 2012 version of Visual Studio, the Dotfuscator extension from the company PreEmptive is installed by default and can be accessed in Tools &gt;** PreEmptive Dotfuscator and Analytics **.</p><p>1- When opening the DotFuscator Interface, start a new project File &gt; New Project.</p><p>2- Click on Inputs and next to it, add the Assembly or Executables that you want to obfuscate.<br>(Ex: ..ProjetoBinMeuProjeto.exe)</p><p>3- Click on Build &gt; Build Project. This process will create a folder in your selected Project directory with the name Dotfuscated and the Executable or DLL with MSIL obfuscated.</p><p>1<br>Okay, your code has been protected and it is not possible to decompile. Now all you have to do is distribute the obfuscated executable to your clients. If you try to do this in Reflector, the result will be an encrypted and unreadable file.</p>]]></content>
